# COVID-19_Distance_Sensor

Recent Covid-19 protocols advise to keep a minimum of six feet between each other to keep transmission low. To ensure that essential workers are kept safe during this time, my “safe reception distance system” will offer a way to enforce social distancing. The system will have a display facing approaching customers to inform them of their current distance to the counter. It will also feature a display facing the receptionist with the number of counter visits they have received and the minimum distance of recent customers.

*Note - The system is currently running on Arduino hardware and software, but will soon be updated with C code to run on an Atmega328P chip.
