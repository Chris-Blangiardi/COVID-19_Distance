COVID-19_Distance_Sensor

This is my junior design project which involved using a sonar sensor to track distance, a seven segment display to print that distance, and a small OLED screen for printing other useful information to users. The project was split into two parts, one using and Arduino and the other a bare metal ATmega328P. The main files for both parts are included and maintain the same functionalities across both files.


Problem Statement and Solution:

Recent Covid-19 protocols advise to keep a minimum of six feet between each other to keep transmission low. To ensure that essential workers are kept safe during this time, my “safe reception distance system” will offer a way to enforce social distancing. The system will have a display facing approaching customers to inform them of their current distance to the counter. It will also feature a display facing the receptionist with the number of counter visits they have received and the minimum distance of recent customers.
